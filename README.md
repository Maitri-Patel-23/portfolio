## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm Maitri Patel, a research analyst at Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research. 
I specialize in solar physics, with research spanning magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, solar flare analysis, and magnetic field modeling.
My work focuses on understanding how complex magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere evolve and trigger energetic events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). I aim to contribute to improved space-weather forecasting through computational modeling and analysis of observational data.

<!--Mention your top/relevant skills here - core and soft skills-->
## WHAT I DO
3D MHD Simulations of eruptive solar flares using data-driven models and numerical solvers.

Magnetic Field Extrapolation (NLFFF) to reconstruct coronal magnetic structures from HMI vector magnetograms.

Computational Tools: Python, FORTRAN, VAPOR.
