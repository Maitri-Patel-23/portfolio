## ABOUT ME

Hello! I'm Maitri Patel, a research analyst at Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research. 
I specialize in solar physics, with research spanning magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, solar flare analysis, and magnetic field modeling.
My work focuses on understanding how complex magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere evolve and trigger energetic events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). I aim to contribute to improved space-weather forecasting through computational modeling and analysis of observational data.

*A glimpse of my recent project I've been working on.*

  <strong>Data-driven MHD Simulation of the Solar Eruption (Initialized from NLFFF)</strong><br>
  This animation presents a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation that models the eruption of the flux rope observed before the X9.0 flare on 31 October 2024. The simulation uses the NLFFF magnetic field as the initial condition, allowing the system to evolve freely under the full MHD equations (numerical model).

Key features shown in the movie:
Rising Flux Rope: The pre-eruptive magnetic structure loses equilibrium and rises rapidly.
Torus Instability: The rope undergoes twisting and expansion as instabilities develop.
Current Sheet Formation: A thin current sheet develops beneath the rising flux rope. As the rope stretches the overlying field, the current sheet becomes longer and more intense, acting as the main site of magnetic reconnection.
Magnetic Reconnection: Field lines reconnect beneath the rope, forming flare loops.
Eruptive Dynamics: The system ejects upward in a CME-like eruption, releasing stored magnetic energy.

This model demonstrates how the transition from a stressed NLFFF structure to a dynamic MHD eruption explains the onset and development of major solar flares.
