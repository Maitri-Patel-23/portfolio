<h1>Data-constrained Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Simulation of X9.0 Flare in Active Region 13842</h1>

<p>
This page provides an extended explanation of my workflow, methodology,
and scientific interpretation behind the NLFFF reconstruction and 
the MHD simulation that models the eruptive X9 flare.
</p>

<h2>1. NLFFF Extrapolation Details</h2>
<p>
Under Prof. Satoshi Inoue’s guidance, my project involved Data-constrained Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Simulation of X9.0 Flare in Active Region 13842, occurred on October 3, 2024, aimed to study the 3D dynamics of X9.0 flare from its initiation to the eruption. In this work, I first processed SDO/HMI vector magnetogram data to derive the photospheric boundary conditions and using it I reconstructed the coronal magnetic field through nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation with relaxation methods. Then I calculated the magnetic twist in the NLFFF model as an indicator of non-potentiality and the decay index to discuss the stability of the Torus Instability. Basically, The NLFFF result revealed the strongly sheared magnetic field lines, leading to the formation of MFR and eventually, the eruption.

  <strong>From Potential Field to NLFFF: Formation of a Pre-Eruptive Flux Rope</strong><br>
  This movie shows the transformation of the coronal magnetic field from a simple potential-field (current-free state) approximation to a full nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model reconstruction. As the model evolves, magnetic shear and twist intensify, revealing the emergence of a flux rope that stores the free magnetic energy responsible for driving the X9.0 flare on 3 October 2024. The NLFFF reconstruction captures increasing magnetic twist, sheared arcades, and the gradual formation of a pre-eruptive flux rope. This transition highlights how non-potential magnetic energy builds up before driving major solar eruptions.

  <strong>Evolution of a Pre-Eruptive Flux Rope (NLFFF Reconstruction)</strong><br>
  This figure shows the time-evolution of the magnetic flux rope in the active region during the 26 hours leading up to 
  the X2.0 flare on 3 October 2024. Using NLFFF extrapolations, I reconstructed the 3D magnetic field and visualized changes 
  in twist, height, and decay index to identify conditions leading to instability and eruption.

<h2>2. MHD Simulation Details</h2>
<p>
To fully understand the stability of MFR, I conducted a data-constrained MHD simulation using the NLFFF model as the initial condition. This numerical model captures the time evolution of the magnetic field from flare initiation to eruption. To run these large-scale simulations efficiently, I used the Fortran-based MHD code and executed the computations on NJIT’s high-performance computing cluster. I used the VAPOR software to visualize the 3D evolution of magnetic structures.

  <strong>Data-driven MHD Simulation of the Solar Eruption (Initialized from NLFFF)</strong><br>
  This animation presents a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation that models the eruption of the flux rope observed before the X9.0 flare on 3 October 2024. The simulation uses the NLFFF magnetic field as the initial condition, allowing the system to evolve freely under the full MHD equations (numerical model).

Key features shown in the movie:
Rising Flux Rope: The pre-eruptive magnetic structure loses equilibrium and rises rapidly.
Torus Instability: The rope undergoes twisting and expansion as instabilities develop.
Current Sheet Formation: A thin current sheet develops beneath the rising flux rope. As the rope stretches the overlying field, the current sheet becomes longer and more intense, acting as the main site of magnetic reconnection.
Magnetic Reconnection: Field lines reconnect beneath the rope, forming flare loops.
Eruptive Dynamics: The system ejects upward in a CME-like eruption, releasing stored magnetic energy.

This model demonstrates how the transition from a stressed NLFFF structure to a dynamic MHD eruption explains the onset and development of major solar flares.

<h2>3. Outcome </h2>
<p>
  My simulations successfully reproduced the eruption of the X9.0 flare. The results are consistent with several observational features from SDO/AIA, including tether-cutting reconnection, flare ribbons and remote brightening. This confirms the accuracy of my calculations and demonstrates my ability to independently execute a complete sequence of numerical simulations. By tracking the reconnection sites, I studied how tether-cutting reconnection beneath the MFR and magnetic flux emergence contribute to the onset of the eruption. This project has strengthened my skills in data-driven modeling, magnetic field analysis, and scientific visualization for understanding the physical processes behind solar activity.
